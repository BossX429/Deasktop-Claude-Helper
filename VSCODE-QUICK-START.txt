| Task | Time | Savings |
|------|------|---------|
| Disable extensions | 3 min | -15% memory |
| Close terminals | 2 min | -10-15% memory |
| Reload VS Code | 1 min | Apply changes |
| **TOTAL** | **5 min** | **25-30% improvement** |

**Return on Investment**: 5 minutes of work = permanent 25-30% speedup

## Questions?

**Q: Is it safe to disable these extensions?**
A: Yes. Quokka, MetaBob, and Ask Codebase overlap with Copilot and Continue. Disabling them won't break anything.

**Q: Can I re-enable an extension later?**
A: Yes. Extensions > gear icon > Enable.

**Q: What if I need Quokka for something?**
A: You can re-enable it. The memory savings come from having fewer simultaneous processes.

**Q: Will changes take effect immediately?**
A: No, reload/restart needed (1 minute).

**Q: Can I undo all changes?**
A: Yes, run the restore command (see "If Something Goes Wrong" section).
